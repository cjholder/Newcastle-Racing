[7.673s] CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
[7.673s]   By not providing "Findeufs_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
[7.674s]   has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
[7.674s]   "eufs_msgs", but CMake did not find one.
[7.674s] 
[7.674s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "eufs_msgs" with
[7.674s]   any of the following names:

[7.675s]     eufs_msgs-config.cmake
[7.675s] 
[7.675s]   Add the installation prefix of "eufs_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
[7.675s]   "eufs_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
[7.675s]   "eufs_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
[7.675s]   been installed.
